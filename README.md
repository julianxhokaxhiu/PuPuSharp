# PuPuSharp
FF8 Field Importer/Exporter - C# version of the original PuPu Project

## What's new
This version inherits the original aesthetic and logic of the original [PuPu Project](https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=13444.0), but has been completely rewritten in C# with VS2022 in mind.

On top of the original base, this version will also onboard changes required to easily export textures that are ready to be consumed by [FFNx](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx).

## Special thanks

Kudos to [Omzy](https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?action=profile;u=8950) for the permission to rewrite the project.
